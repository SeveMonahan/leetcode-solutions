This is a repo of my leetcode solutions.

I always keep working on problems until I have the best asympototic time
complexity, unless the problem is about optimizing memory usage, in which case
I optimize the memory complexity instead.

The solutions are divided into 50 problem chunks, with the folder name being
the first problem within (except the 00 folder for problems 1-49). Note that I
jump around the list sometimes - if you notice a big gap, that's why.

I cycle thru different programming langauges to keep current on all of them,
the programming langauge is implictly encoded by the file extension. .py is
always Python 3.
