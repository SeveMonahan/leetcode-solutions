This is a repo of my leetcode solutions.

I always keep working on the problem until I have the best asympototic time
complexity, unless the problem is about optimizing memory usage, in which case
I optimized the memory complexity instead.

The solutions are divided into 100 problem chunks, with the folder name being
the first problem addresses (except the 00 folder for problems 1-99).

I cycle thru different programming langauges to keep current on all of them,
the programming langauge is implictly encoded by the file extension. .py is
always Python 3.
